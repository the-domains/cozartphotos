I was working with a client who was deciding to fly out to have a 
photo session with me -- or not.  She asked, "An insecure person may 
trust the photographer, but what if she trusts the wrong photographer? 
Wouldn't that do more damage than good?"

**She is absolutely correct.**

The wrong photographer working with someone in a depressed state of 
mind can make that depression worse. Depression is so deeply damaging. **Depression comes in many forms**,
including post-divorce, postpartum depression, past abuse, etc. The 
problem is, most of the time we photographers don't know what's on a 
person's mind. It's really not a typical thing for a photographer to 
build into their workflow.  Usually, the client makes an appointment and
the photographer works with this "stranger" to put them in standard 
posing and backgrounds, etc. The client **"hopes that this time will be different"** and typically ends up not loving their photos. Seems rather clinical and rather futile.

Truly building rapport with the subject is critically important 
before, during, and after the shoot. I strive to know enough about the 
subject to understand her state of mind, and work with discussion, 
meditation, visualization, etc. to **begin the healing and clearing of the Photosphere**. For those who aren't familiar with it -- I believe that we all have an unseen layer of energy around us called a **"Photosphere"**,
that can distort how we appear in photos based on how we affect it with
our negative thoughts and feelings about ourselves and the photographic
process. A Photosphere that is clear and strong -- not warped, clouded, 
distorted or polluted will allow our true essence to be shown and 
photographed.

I also realize that I can never replace a trained, medical or clinical professional.(**My ****clients say I'm more fun than a doctor or shrink anyway!**)
I learn when to listen and know when to ask the right questions, how to
ask them, where to ask them, and why to ask them, to help build that 
rapport and better understand my client. If a photographer's is 
depressed and that photographer doesn't know how to recognize it, no 
matter how slight the depression may be, it can lead to a bad situation.

In my experience, the trust that is built in phone calls, Skype video
work and of course, the webinar I offer prior to any shoot I do with my
Camera-Ready VIP clients truly produces a happy and more confident 
client.

**I Believe In...** "The power of photography to help 
build or re-build self esteem by first gaining useful knowledge about 
photography, developing skills that provide confidence and empowerment, 
then becoming **"WEDDING DAY EXCITED"** to reveal your truly beautiful and authentic photos to the world! **Yes -- YOU can learn to love the camera and your image!**

Oh -- my client? Happy and loving her new photos. She immediately got the **confidence** to put her face on her business and launch a tele-seminar series that **sold more seats than she ever had before!**

I invite you to join my community and keep in touch with how you can learn to be Camera-Ready everyday! Don't worry -- **I'll always respect your privacy**.
I also will not spam you with tons of dumb offers, etc. You'll get 
occasional updates, offers and valuable tips on looking your best in 
photography everyday.
