Gang -- here's a quick weight-loss tip.  In photos, watch your posture! Straightening up will drop 5 lbs in the camera's eye.  This doesn't mean stiffening up and arching back. It means shoulders shouldn't be sloping. It means -well, think of a standing crunch! Don't arch your back..do a concave "crunch" with your tummy. When you arch backward, your tummy pokes out. Tummy in...chin forward (not up) and shoulders back.

Sound like a ski lesson? Yup! Looking good in photos is a learned thing. Most red carpet types are taught -- it's not something you're born with.

The truth is, most people don't think about looking great in photos until they book a photographer. My goal is to teach you how to be Camera-ready everyday!
